# Audio Event Detection via Deep Learning
_Robert Coop, Ph.D._

This is the companion code for my talk at the Data Science ATL Conference 2018.

In order to run --
1. Clone this repository into a new virtual environment.
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to get the required packages
3. Download `https://storage.googleapis.com/audioset/vggish_model.ckpt` and `https://storage.googleapis.com/audioset/vggish_pca_params.npz` and place them in the `dsatl_lib` directory.
4. Open up Jupyter Notebook and view the code.


*NOTE* - you should use a virtual environment and `pip install -r requirements.txt` to run this code.  In particular, this code was built off PyDub 0.20, which has some odd incompatibility with PyDub 0.23.  There may be other similar issues.  You've been warned.
