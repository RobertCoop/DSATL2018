# Audio Event Detection via Deep Learning
_Robert Coop, Ph.D._

This is the companion code for my talk at the Data Science ATL Conference 2018.

*NOTE* - you should use a virtual environment and `pip install -r requirements.txt` to run this code.  In particular, this code was built off PyDub 0.20, which has some odd incompatibility with PyDub 0.23.  There may be other similar issues.  You've been warned.
